## This is a tensorflow implementation of Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning from Google DeepMind based on OpenAI baselines.

## If you wish to experiment with the algorithm

##### Check out the examples

- [baselines/rainbow/experiments/atari/rainbow.py](experiments/atari/train.py) - more robust setup for training at scale.
- By default, dueling dqn is disabled, since it affect the stability of rainbow for the moment(Not observed in DeepMind 
rainbow paper.).
You can run the code as follows.
```bash
python -m baselines.rainbow.experiments.atari.rainbow --env Pong --save-dir Pong 
```

- Various Improvements can be enabled by the argument options.
- Standard C51 can be obtained just disable other options such as dueling, double and so on.

## Todo
- Make rainbow stable with dueling.
- Add N step
